Often, you don't need a training plan, you just need someone to talk to. Someone to tell you your injury isn't the end of the world, or that your goal is achievable with a well thought-out plan, or that there's a perfectly good reason you aren't seeing progress, and that's still a good thing. If that sounds like you, then don't hesitate.

If at the end of your call, you think a personalized training plan is what you need, shoot me a message. We'll work out the details and get you squared away.  Please check out my [testimonials](http:///chr0nikler.github.io/testimonials) from previous clients if you are on the fence.
