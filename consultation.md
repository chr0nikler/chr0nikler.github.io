Often, you don't need a training plan, you just need someone to talk to. Someone to tell you your injury isn't the end of the world, or that your goal is achievable with a well thought-out plan, or that there's a perfectly good reason you aren't seeing progress, and that's still a good thing. If that sounds like you, then don't hesitate.

If at the end of your call, you think a personalized training plan is what you need, shoot me a message. We'll work out the details and get you squared away.  Please check out my [testimonials](http:///chr0nikler.github.io/testimonials) from previous clients if you are on the fence.

What are my specialties? 

First, I'm an [NASM CPT](https://www.nasm.org/certified-personal-trainer-a) and a licensed [PPSC Coach](https://getppsc.com/). When it comes to the nuts and bolts of training, I have you covered.

But after training for ten years, my specialty lies in achieving goals despite injury. With injury or adversity,  I take my time to understand what the best in the business do to  handle similar injuries, and scale the expectations down to what is possible.  Who's got the strongest and most explosive calves in any task? Ballet dancers. Who has the strongest and most mobile shoulders? Gymnasts and circus artists.  Studying the best reveals how  even recreational athletes can achieve more than they  previously thought possible.

Sometimes you have to rest. But there are plenty of ways to keep inching towards your goals without letting injury stop you.

Here are some of my recent numbers with regards to athletic performance:

- 181 lb, 12.1% body fat as of January 2024
- 32 inch vertical
- 210 lb power clean
- 240 lb bench press
- 500 lb trap bar deadlift

There is a glaring lack of any endurance achievements, but my sport choices tend to be more anaerobic in nature.

This is a non-exhaustive list of what injuries I've been through:

- Jumper's Knee (Patellar Tendinopathy)
- Shoulder Surgery (Anterior Labrum repair)
- Bicep Surgery (Bicep Tendon Repair)
- Plantar Fasciopathy
- Achilles Tendinopathy
- Lower Back Disc Herniation
- Golfer's Elbow (Medial Epicondylitis)
- ACL Reconstruction Surgery with Partial Menisectomy 

In spite of many of these injuries, I've continue to play volleyball at a competitive level, including a two-day indoor tournament as a middle blocker. I've done my best to enjoy sport even in times of less than stellar health.

Regardless of where you are in your fitness journey, I hope I can help you succeed.
