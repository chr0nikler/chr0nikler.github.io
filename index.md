Hi. I'm Joraaver Chahal. I'm a software engineer and personal trainer trying to broaden my horizons. For example, right now I'm trying to launch an app focused on improving the standard of care for physical therapy after surgery, starting with [ACL reconstruction](https://diffzero.com).

I have some degree of expertise in software engineering and sports rehabilitation. I'd like to feel this way about business, money, writing, and music too. Time will tell. 

Most of my free time is occupied playing video games or volleyball, learning the saxophone, and providing training services to others. This blog exists to ensure I practice writing using even prosaic topics if necessary.

Happy reading.
