Hi. I'm Joraaver Chahal. I'm a software engineer and personal trainer constantly trying to broaden my horizons.

I have some degree of expertise in software engineering and sports rehabilitation. The former,  through work. The latter,  as a personal trainer and someone who has been through the wringer with regards to injury. I'd like to learn about other topics too, such as business, money, writing, music, etc. Only time will tell. 

I've stopped trying to explain how I use my free time because it always changes with circumstances of my life. So instead, I'm going to tell you that my free time is occupied by either some focused mental work, some focused physical work, or some unfocused relaxation. I believe that covers the universe of activities. What those particular activities happen to be at any time is anyone's guess.

In spite of the above, this blog exists to ensure I practice writing, using even prosaic topics if necessary.

Happy reading.
