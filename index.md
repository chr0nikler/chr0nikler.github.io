Hi. I'm Joraaver Chahal. I *was* a software engineer. Now I'm trying to launch a startup focused on improving the standard of care for physical therapy after surgery, starting with [ACL reconstruction](https://diffzero.com).

Right now,  I have some degree of expertise in software engineering and sports rehabilitation. I'd like to feel this way about business, money, writing, and music too. Time will tell. 

Most of my free time is occupied playing video games or volleyball, learning the saxophone, and providing training services to others. This blog exists to ensure I practice writing using even prosaic topics if necessary.

Happy reading.
