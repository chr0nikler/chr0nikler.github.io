### Equipment

These are products that I recommend my clients invest in depending on what they do. Some are performance, some are for rehab, some makes more sense in a gym, some are specifically for use at home. This page is a work in progress. 


#### [Tidal Tank](https://www.tidal-tank.com/pages/_go_?ref=3152:689047&discount=METEORIC)

I like using the Tidal Tank for late-stage rehab or general return-to-sport preparation for ankle, knee, or shoulder issues.  It provides an easy way to simulate unprepared contact and improve confidence in your joints. This is an often overlooked aspect of rehab for recreational athletes, as the neurological coordination and timing is still missing from otherwise pain-freej joints,  which can lead to recurring joint issues down the road. 

If you aren't injured but are returning to sport after a couple of months off, going back to your previous level of play is a recipe for disaster. Using the Tidal Tank in a few of your workouts before returning to sport is a much gentler way to ensure your body is ready for any kind of movement it needs to react to.
