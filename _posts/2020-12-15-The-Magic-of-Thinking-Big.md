*Success is an unfailing mindset repeatedly committed to and acted upon.*

*The Magic of Thinking Big*, by Dr. David J. Schwartz, is a short and measured reminder of who we can be, of who we still could be. At work, in society, at home: everywhere, the chance to improve one's current conditions lies in the ability to think "big." According to Dr. Schwartz, thinking "big" amounts to positivity, action, personability, and the relentless pursuit that comes with self-improvement. He occasionally neglects unforgiving circumstances in favor of his "can do" attitude, but that doesn't detract from his message on what it takes to think "big."  Dr. Schwartz provides excellent examples and exercises that gently guide you through what thinking "big" looks like. He encourages you to work on a variety of tasks such writing your own pep talk, drafting what you specifically want ten years from now, and asking questions of people you'd normally fear asking to see how they respond. I couldn't help but compare my life experiences to his examples, noting where I had done well or where I had fallen short. The thought exercise alone is worth it, but Dr. Schwartz would be quick to point out that thought alone does not bring about success.

It's worth noting that his ideas aren't new, especially in this age of increased conversation, communication, and mental health. While they may not come across the same, ideas in the book like "humanness", leadership, and time spent by oneself on one's self are kindred concepts. Thinking "big" requires peeling back the layers of the onion. By drilling down to the core beliefs, nurturing the good ones, and denying the ones that would have us remain mediocre, Dr. Schwartz believes we can, to paraphrase, "lift ourselves up to the uncrowded territory of success."  And I'm inclined to believe that too.
          
This is a book that has been sitting in my parents' library for years, but I'm glad I only read it now. I think I shall treat this book like I do Marcus Aurelius's *Meditations*, since they serve similar purposes. I'll occasionally prop it open to remind myself how to proceed, although a simple glance at the book after having read it is often reminder enough.
