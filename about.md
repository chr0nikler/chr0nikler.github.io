I'm Joraaver Chahal.

I was born in New York City, but have lived in California most of my life.

I'm quite passionate about pursuing "clarity of thought." That tends to manifest as lots of knowledge about a peculiar skill. It frustrates me to no end when I don't have a decent mental framework about a certain subject. 

Right now, the subjects that I can confidently say I have some degree of expertise in are software engineering and sports rehabilitation. I'd like to feel this way about business, money, writing, and music too. But I've got time to work with.
