Before I discuss the book, I want to tell you why I read this book. You'll never know where your next book will come from.

In the waning heat of  first week of June my friends and I were enjoying dinner at [Farmhouse Kitchen](https://www.yelp.com/biz/farmhouse-kitchen-thai-cuisine-menlo-park-2?osq=thai). One of said friends likes to probe our minds with interesting, but somewhat nonsensical questions. What followed next is the natural course of me entertaining her question.

"If you could learn any language in the world, but had to eat a person to learn that language, would you do it, and who would you eat?" she asked, during a lull in our conversation. For sake of brevity, I skip our little discussion about the morality of eating a person, as you can already guess what my answer is.

"Anyone, dead or alive, past or present?" I inquired. This was an innocent question. I had no ill-intent, initially.

"Uhh, okay yes. Anyone. But you also inherent their memories," she responded. This stipulation was strictly added in anticpation of me picking a heinous being like Jack the Ripper.  From her perspective, as a lover of languages, the torment of living with those memories would greatly outweigh the desire to know any language, let alone ... Old English, for this example. Unfortunately, it's difficult to anticpate me. 

I exclaimed that I would want nothing more to consume Genghis Khan and know everything about the largest empire that ever existed. And of course, to learn their language. Of course.

A relentless stream of questions followed. Can you live with killing millions of people? What language did they even speak? You'd see all the rape and looting, and you could continue living with that?  Honestly, with such a hypothetical question, I wasn't giving it that much thought. Maybe at the end of the day, I'd become a raving lunatic, but at least I'd know what it was like.

What was the outcome of our serious academic discussion? That we didn't know diddly-squat about Genghis Khan, and whatever we were saying during the discussion was us parroting our vague memories about his exploits from a 7th grade textbook. 

A day or two later one of the other friends at our dinner messaged me about spotting a book about Genghis Khan at Costco. Within a few texts  we discovered her father had a copy of the book and that she could loan it to me. Another day went by and I was finally in possession of <u>Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World</u> by Jack Weatherford. Without the ultimate primary source, this book and its collection of primary sources would serve as his replacement.

Now that I got the entertaining bits out of the way, lets dive into what truly memorialized Genghis Khan.

I've split this summary into three parts that matter to me: the rise and fall of the symbol that is Genghis Khan, the geographical scope and military tactics of the Mongol Empire, and the geopolitical and socioeconomic impact of the empire. I do not wish to write about "the rise, the expansion, and the fall" of the Mongol Empire because that is a chronological retelling of the book in way I will not do justice. Instead it is my hope that from my summary of abstract topics, you will be intrigued enough to pick up the book and devour the details.  Weatherford has covered every facet of Genghis Khan's life and his impact in the modern world. Right from the introduction, he invites you to revel in a piece of history that for 500 years was shrouded in so much secrecy I'm suprised it wasn't the center of another Indiana Jones film.
