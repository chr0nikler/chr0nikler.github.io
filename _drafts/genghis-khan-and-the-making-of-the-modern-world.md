Before I discuss the book <u>Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World</u> by Jack Weatherford, I want to tell you why I read this book. You'll never know where your next book will come from.

In the waning afternoon heat of the first Thursday in June, my friends and I enjoyed dinner at [Farmhouse Kitchen](https://www.yelp.com/biz/farmhouse-kitchen-thai-cuisine-menlo-park-2?osq=thai). One of said friends likes to probe our minds with interesting but somewhat nonsensical questions during our social gatherings. What followed next is the natural course of me entertaining her question.

"If you could learn any language in the world, but had to eat a person to learn that language, would you do it, and who would you eat?" she asked, during a lull in our conversation. For sake of brevity, I skip our little discussion about the morality of eating a person, as you can already guess what my answer is.

"Anyone, dead or alive, past or present?" I inquired. This was an innocent question. I had no ill-intent, initially.

"Uhh, okay yes. Anyone. But you also inherent their memories," she responded. This stipulation was strictly added in anticpation of me picking a heinous being like Jack the Ripper.  From her perspective, as a lover of languages, the torment of living with those memories would greatly outweigh the desire to know any language, let alone ... Old English, for this example. Unfortunately for her, it's difficult to anticpate me. 

I exclaimed that I would want nothing more to consume Genghis Khan and know everything about the largest land empire that ever existed. And of course, to learn their language. Of course.

A relentless stream of questions followed. Can you live with killing millions of people? What language did they even speak? You'd see all the rape and looting, and you could continue living with that?  Honestly, with such a hypothetical question, I wasn't giving it that much thought. Maybe at the end of the day, I'd become a raving lunatic, but at least I'd know what it was like.

What was the outcome of our serious academic discussion? That we didn't know diddly-squat about Genghis Khan, and whatever we were saying during the discussion was us parroting our vague memories about his exploits from a 7th grade textbook. 

A day or two later one of the other friends at our dinner messaged me about spotting a book about Genghis Khan at Costco. Within a few texts  we discovered her father had a copy of the book and that she could loan it to me. Another day went by and I was finally in possession of <u>Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World</u>. Without the ultimate primary source, this book and its collection of primary sources would serve as his replacement.

Now that I got the entertaining bits out of the way, lets dive into what truly memorialized Genghis Khan.

I've split this summary into three parts that matter to me: 
- The military prowess of the Genghis Khan.
- The geopolitical and socioeconomic impact of the Mongol Empire.
- The symbol that is Genghis Khan.

I do not wish to write about "the rise, the expansion, and the fall" of the Mongol Empire because that is a chronological retelling of the book in way I will not do justice. Instead it is my hope that from my summary of abstract topics, you will be intrigued enough to pick up the book and devour the details.  Weatherford has painstakingly covered every facet of Genghis Khan's life and his impact in the modern world. Right from the introduction, he invites you to revel in a piece of history that for 500 years was shrouded in so much secrecy I'm suprised it wasn't the center of another Indiana Jones film. 
## The Military Prowess of Genghis Khan
I have always said with regards to sports or athletic endeavors that, all else being equal, "speed kills." It is the opponent that hits faster, feints quicker,  adapts sooner, that will win the day. I think this summarizes Genghis Khan well.

On the steppes of Mongolia, men are warriors for  they must provide for their family. As nomads, they made great use of the lands resources, and were adept bowmen and horsemen.  Strangely enough, this same set of skills that came normally to his people are what made them feared throughout  Asia and Europe.  

As his conquests took him further into the Middle East, his campaigns would take him long distances. Normal armies required vast supply chains of food and water and moved slowly due to the number of foot soldiers. The Khan's army was swift on horseback. His soldiers carried what they little they needed with them and hunted as necessary. The only thing that prevented them from speedy travel was often stifling climate, which they experienced as they trekked across the Gobi and further into China and India. For most of their initial campaigns, however, climated did not impeded them. In general, his men were fresher and more capable in combat that another army traveling of equal distance.

He had never seen a city before his conquest, let alone a walled city or fortress, but as I said, not only was he fast of foot, he was fast of mind as well. Genghis Khan rapidly understood the nuances of city warfare. He would ravage villages outside the city first in order to drive as many refugees as possible into the city walls.  This would increase the pressure on resources that the city could not support, and would drive the tension and panic within the walls through the roof as the refugees spread news of a terrifying forces that launched attacks at breakneck speeds.

Genghis Khan was one of the first innovators of tactical yet swift army maneuvers due to his cavalary-only army. He introduced the decimal system into his army, with groups of 10, 100, and 1000 making up units in his army, as well as organizational techniques to ensure a chain of command that could relay messages tens of miles in the blink of an eye. Remember, before this the tribes of Mongolia had never come together, let alone form a standing army. Genghis Khan was the first person to unite the tribes and thus had to layout a new military system without having been formally taught one.  

In one example maneuver, he would bait the enemy into chasing them into a chaotic looking retreat. Then, as the enemy horses tired, Genghis Khan's troops would reach an outer circle where soldiers kept fresh horses waiting. In an extremely violent turn of the tables, the Khan's soldiers, with bow skills on horseback the rest of the world had yet to witness, slew the enemy in a matter of minutes. It was often total annihilation. 

The art of siege warfare was still new to Genghis Khan at first, but it did not prevent his advance. It took him several tries, but he learned how to dam nearby rivers to flood cities (one try involved flooding one of his own camps). Eventually, the people inside would starve, and he would have his victory. To the Mongol there was no concept of a "noble" way to win. You fought, you retreated, and you used whatever means necessary to win. What others wrote in their history books wrote as barbaric and ignoble, Genghis Khan reflected upon as an adaptation to a new style of warfare.

The conquest of nations afforded Genghis Khan new techniques in his arsenal. He learned about battering rams and mobile attack towers, and the destructive might of catapaults and trebuchets. However, his army did not lug such heavy equipment around. Instead, after scouting and strategizing, his men would build them if necssary. Genghi's  army always remained mobile and burden-free. 

One question my dinner table posed was whether he was a front line fighter or a king who sent his armies off to battle as the Mongol Empire grew? He was the leader of a nomadic people, with a standing army of all capable men fighting. It seems ridiculous to answer this question now, but until the age of sixty, he fought on the front lines  away from his homeland for up to five years at a time. 

Finally, a small blurb on geography, because war and geography are always intertwined.

This is the total extent of the Mongol empire about 150 years after Genghis Khan passed away. His sons did what they could to expand the empire, but their interests would never align in a singular vision the way Genghis Khan intended. For example, the son that took over his position insisted on building a home city that he would  occupy, rather than constantly be on the front lines. The idea of cenral city for the Mongol Empire flew in the face of how Genghis Khan operated his empire. Still, the four corners that marked the edge of his empire are the shores of Korea, the tip of Egypt, the cold harsh landscape of Siberia, and just beyond the Crimea and current day Ukraine. 

There is always more to be said about Genghis Khan at war. After all, even the Germans and Russians sought to decipher the *Secret History* that best summarized his exploits in order to better understand total war. Even the German *blitzkrieg* is named after techniques Genghis invented. Tank formations alongside infanty are inspired by the Mongol's cavalry-centric warfare. 

## The Geopolitcal and Socioeconomic Impact of the Mongol Empire
Waves of contact and isolation amongst nations often demarcate periods of progress or stagnation. Isolation, which inhibits the exchange of ideas and innovation, solidifies cultural practices and the homogeneity of a people's identity. I would argue this is the default state of nations, and as history progressed, becoming an economic powerhouse, or conversely, not being left behind in the race for globalization, nations had to move from full isolation to full contact. I introduce this as a "thesis sentence" to illustrate how I view the overarching impact the Mongol Empire had on today's society. 

Genghis Khan quickly realized that uniting people of different backgrounds was no simple task, even amongst the different tribes across the steppes of Mongol. One of the first "innovations" he implemented was a rule of law that no one superceded. An idea we take for granted (though tested again and again in today's U.S. political climate) had its original implementation tried on a grand scale 900 years ago.  Standard law required writing down too, but the illiterate Mongols had no written word.  Genghis Khan ordered a written language be invented so that they could not only have the law written for record, but also to better improve communication within his empire.

In the previous section I discussed how little Genghis Khan cared for strict authority presence to exist within his conquered cities. In a larger sense, Genghis Khan and the Mongols had no sense of pride that demanded a continuous identity throughout his empire. That meant religion was not a pushed subject; the Mongols were spiritual at first, and though the different rules adopted Christianity or Buddhism through the years, there was no persecution of their people for believeing differently. The Mongols were illiterate, and so had no attachment to a written word. They relied on Chinese intellectuals to invent a character set that would make the most practical sense. One of the biggest takeaways from his style of rule was that a conquered nation did not need their pride trampled on, and identities could continue to exist as long as they weren't incongruent to the point of revolt. 

Let's discuss trade for a moment. Genghis Khan brought enormous wealth to his people. So much so that later on it became part of the reason for its collapse, as his people back home lost the ability to cope with a spartan lifestyle over the coure of 200 years. Nonetheless, exposure to new materials like silk and cotton, inventions such as gunpoweder, crafting techniques like shipbuilding,  and the simplest of all, new styles of food, became a quintessential part of the Mongol Empire. However,  trade initially relied on a system of valuation that changed from post to post. Previously, Genghis Khan had seen the value of paper in it's ease of distribution and carry. He sought to establish a reliable paper currency backed by all the stored wealth in his home nation, the way money used to be back by gold, and started to issue bills within his Empire. For a brief moment in time, the Mongol Empire introduced a system of stabilizing money across vast distances. 

Genghis Khan realized a need for time standarization as well due to trade. Traders could not reliable communicate times and dates due to the differences in calendars as well as our much beloved timezone challenges. The Khan ordered his best astronomers to understand the shift in time and construct a calendar and a time could establish a moment in time in point A, and it's corresponding time in point B, and it did wonders in improving trade relationships.

I mentioned freedom of religion before, but it must be stressed. Genghis Khan was adamant about his implementation of freedom of religion. When he conquered the Middle East, he did not force the Muslims or the Jews to adopt different lifestyles. When presented with Christianity at the edges of Europe, his people could not understand their ways, but he did not see them as wrong. In fact, once the Mongol Empire was well established, regular debates were often scheduled between different religious scholars as intellectual exercises. 

And what of culture? I mentioned in the beginning that contact between nations necessitates the intermingling of culture. As much as the Mongols were influenced by the cultures of the people they conquered, with the lavish new lifestyle they enjoyed and the rapid progress in different sectors, the Mongols left their mark on the people they conquered, not in what they did, but in who they were. 


## The Symbol that is Genghis Khan

A rhetorical question to set the stage. Do you think the largest contiguous empire the world ever saw was ruled strictly by fear (I must say continguous because otherwise the British Empire claims the title)? Of course not. It was ruled by understanding the simple desires of people, but forever ensuring that his people had access to everything else the world had to offer, and nothing less. None of this was done out of malice, and yet, as described by my very table of jokers, all we know is the Mongol Empire's malice. How did we get here?

Genkhis Khan's first blood was his step brother. The decision was simple. He could not fathom yielding to his older sibling, who's decision-making he considered inane. It would earn him the curses of his mother, for death was not taken lightly in the Mongol culture, especially inter-family killing. However, this moment illustrates a separation in thinking by Genghis Khan from the rest of his kin. To others, family was highest social structure, and it was not to be betrayed. To Genghis Khan, family would be a blessing and a curse, but nothing more than a tool at the end of the day. "The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb" is an apt phrase, capturing how Genghis Khan evolved his empire because it allowed him to exit the traditional mindset that kept his people so divided. 

As you may have guessed, the trait he held in highest regard was loyalty. Loyalty demonstrated in the past, and loyalty that continued every day. I make this distinction because while growing up, Genghis Khan had formed a brotherly bond with another warrior, <name>, who he held in equal regard. However, that friendship would turn to betrayal, and like many before Genghis Khan, if one did not demonstrate loyalty, one chose death.

I will return to loyalty in a moment, but I must first discuss how the Genghis Khan expanded his rule to further develop his person. Imagine a man who wanted only the best for his people, but every time he sought connection with others in hopes of trade and the exchange of ideas, his people were hurt, leaving him no choice but to fight. That is Genghis Khan. He was a man who would not yield, and if an envoy he sent was met with execution, then his executioners would endure the same fate.
	
Knowing this, whenever he conquered, whether it was a tribe, a city, or a nation, he would let the conquered peoples live as they were, but under his authority. That meant no  disruption of life, no barbaric execution, and no pillaging. If his armies were caught doing any of these shameful acts, they were shown no mercy.  But for a newly conquered people, this is when loyalty mattered the most. An unfortunate city may misunderstand his lax rule and stage a revolt. That city was met with swift and utter destruction.  
	
To his people Genghis Khan represented true warrior leadership. One that ensured fierce protection of their people while ushering in a new era of luxury.  To be associated with or descended from the great Khan was to inherit the same blessings he possesed from the Eternal Blue Sky or the Mountains of Bakkhur. 
	
But what was the opionion of the conquered peoples? What did they see in Genghis Khan?
	
At first, when nobody knew his name, the word in the air was about the looks of him and his army. Of wide eyes, rugged bodies, taut skin. Denigrating descriptions that instilled fear of a barbaric race from the northeast that were killing machines.
	
But that attitude changed as Genghis Khan conquered nation after nation, and each nation began to experience trade and innovation. To the literate folk, Genghis Khan was not only military giant, but a thought leader. Nobody would could deny his knack for gather minds brighter than his in domains of science, art, religion in order to change how business was done on a day to day basis. After all, before this point in time no empire this large existed, and implementing systems to manage groups of people across different timezones, ethnic backgrounds, religions, and currencies was unheard of.
	
However, there is a reason me and my friends only knew Genghis Khan for his ferocious and inhuman behavior. What we know today is always history written by the victors, unless we choose to go find altnerate material than the ones that plague our modern society. 
	
Voltaire first published a play, using Genghis Khan and the Mongol people as a way to attack the French royalty without specifiying them. He abused points about brute strength and violence while once again returning to the initial descriptions of the Mongols in his attempts to slander those in power.
	
Later, during the Enlightenment Period in Europe, scientists did everything they could to classify humans by facial features. If the Caucasian features ranked the highest in terms of intelligence and beauty, the Mongol features became associated with everything ugly and stupid. Don't assume this is an idea far removed from our time period.  Here is a ngram chart for the the term "mongoloid" which is defined as "offensive" and is an "old-fashioned term for a person with Down syndrome": 
	
	


	

What Genghis Khan represents is a beautiful illustration of the arc of history and knowledge. He is well known for his military ferocity and the empire he once ruled. I know him now for his willigness to break social norms, his leadership skills as a uniter of people, and his innovation in military, law, politics, economics, religion, and writing. But for the uneducated, it is the single paragraph or two about terror and violence and terror in a history textbook on world history that is remembered. The usage of the offensive word previously defined is an indication of  while the belief about Mongol facial features and intelligence may not be as pervasive as it once was, it still holds root and reminds us that our belief is system is reflected in the very words that we use.

That wasn't too long a summary, was it? Thanks for reading this to the end if you did. As always I write these essays too consolidate my knoweldge in the hope that I retain half of what I've written, and an eighth of what I've read. If you want to know more, I urge you to pick up the book to fill in all the gaps I've left about the coming and going of the man named Genghis Khan.
