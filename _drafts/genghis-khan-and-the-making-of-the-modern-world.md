Before I discuss the book <u>Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World</u> by Jack Weatherford, I want to tell you why I read this book. You'll never know where your next book will come from.

In the waning heat of  first week of June my friends and I were enjoying dinner at [Farmhouse Kitchen](https://www.yelp.com/biz/farmhouse-kitchen-thai-cuisine-menlo-park-2?osq=thai). One of said friends likes to probe our minds with interesting, but somewhat nonsensical questions. What followed next is the natural course of me entertaining her question.

"If you could learn any language in the world, but had to eat a person to learn that language, would you do it, and who would you eat?" she asked, during a lull in our conversation. For sake of brevity, I skip our little discussion about the morality of eating a person, as you can already guess what my answer is.

"Anyone, dead or alive, past or present?" I inquired. This was an innocent question. I had no ill-intent, initially.

"Uhh, okay yes. Anyone. But you also inherent their memories," she responded. This stipulation was strictly added in anticpation of me picking a heinous being like Jack the Ripper.  From her perspective, as a lover of languages, the torment of living with those memories would greatly outweigh the desire to know any language, let alone ... Old English, for this example. Unfortunately, it's difficult to anticpate me. 

I exclaimed that I would want nothing more to consume Genghis Khan and know everything about the largest land empire that ever existed. And of course, to learn their language. Of course.

A relentless stream of questions followed. Can you live with killing millions of people? What language did they even speak? You'd see all the rape and looting, and you could continue living with that?  Honestly, with such a hypothetical question, I wasn't giving it that much thought. Maybe at the end of the day, I'd become a raving lunatic, but at least I'd know what it was like.

What was the outcome of our serious academic discussion? That we didn't know diddly-squat about Genghis Khan, and whatever we were saying during the discussion was us parroting our vague memories about his exploits from a 7th grade textbook. 

A day or two later one of the other friends at our dinner messaged me about spotting a book about Genghis Khan at Costco. Within a few texts  we discovered her father had a copy of the book and that she could loan it to me. Another day went by and I was finally in possession of <u>Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World</u>. Without the ultimate primary source, this book and its collection of primary sources would serve as his replacement.

Now that I got the entertaining bits out of the way, lets dive into what truly memorialized Genghis Khan.

I've split this summary into three parts that matter to me: 
- The symbol that is Genghis Khan.
- The military prowess of the Genghis Khan.
- The geopolitical and socioeconomic impact of the Mongol Empire.

I do not wish to write about "the rise, the expansion, and the fall" of the Mongol Empire because that is a chronological retelling of the book in way I will not do justice. Instead it is my hope that from my summary of abstract topics, you will be intrigued enough to pick up the book and devour the details.  Weatherford has painstakingly covered every facet of Genghis Khan's life and his impact in the modern world. Right from the introduction, he invites you to revel in a piece of history that for 500 years was shrouded in so much secrecy I'm suprised it wasn't the center of another Indiana Jones film. 

## The Military Prowess of Genghis Khan
I have always said with regards to sports or athletic endeavors that, all else being equal, "speed kills." It is the opponent that hits faster, feints quicker,  adapts sooner, that will win the day. I think this summarize Genghis Khan well.

On the steppes of Mongolia, men are warriors for  they must provide for their family. As nomads, they made great use of the lands resources, and were adept bowmen and horsemen.  Strangely enough, this same set of skills that came normally to his people are what made them feared throughout  Asia and Europe.  

As his conquests took him further into the Middle East, his campaigns would take him long distances. Normal armies required vast supply chains of food and water and moved slowly due to the number of foot soldiers. The Khan's army was swift on horseback. His soldiers carried what they little they needed with them and hunted as necessary. The only thing that prevented them from speedy travel was often stifling climate, which they experienced as they trekked across the Gobi and further into China and India. For most of their initial campaigns, however, climated did not impeded them. In general, his men were fresher and more capable in combat that another army traveling of equal distance.

He had never seen a city before his conquest, let alone a walled city or fortress, but as I said, not only was he fast of foot, he was fast of mind as well. Genghis Khan rapidly understood the nuances of city warfare. He would ravage villages outside the city first in order to drive as many refugees as possible into the city walls.  This would increase the pressure on resources that the city could not support, and would drive the tension and panic within the walls through the roof as the refugees spread news of a terrifying forces that launched attacks at breakneck speeds.

Genghis Khan was one of the first innovators of tactical yet swift army maneuvers due to his cavalary-only army. He introduced the decimal system into his army, with groups of 10, 100, and 1000 making up units in his army, as well as organizational techniques to ensure a chain of command that could relay messages tens of miles in the blink of an eye. Remember, before this the tribes of Mongolia had never come together, let alone form a standing army. Genghis Khan was the first person to unite the tribes and thus had to layout a new military system without having been formally taught one.  

In one example maneuver, he would bait the enemy into chasing them into a chaotic looking retreat. Then, as the enemy horses tired, Genghis Khan's troops would reach an outer circle where soldiers kept fresh horses waiting. In an extremely violent turn of the tables, the Khan's soldiers, with bow skills on horseback the rest of the world had yet to witness, slew the enemy in a matter of minutes. It was often total annihilation. 

The art of siege warfare was still new to Genghis Khan at first, but it did not prevent his advance. It took him several tries, but he learned how to dam nearby rivers to flood cities (one try involved flooding one of his own camps). Eventually, the people inside would starve, and he would have his victory. To the Mongol there was no concept of a "noble" way to win. You fought, you retreated, and you used whatever means necessary to win. What others wrote in their history books wrote as barbaric and ignoble, Genghis Khan reflected upon as an adaptation to a new style of warfare.

The conquest of nations afforded Genghis Khan new techniques in his arsenal. He learned about battering rams and mobile attack towers, and the destructive might of catapaults and trebuchets. However, his army did not lug such heavy equipment around. Instead, after scouting and strategizing, his men would build them if necssary. Genghi's  army always remained mobile and burden-free, as a nomad  is.

Finally, a small blurb on geography, because war and geography are always intertwined

This is the total extent of the Mongol empire about 150 years after Genghis Khan passed away. His sons did what they could to expand the empire, but their interests would never align in a singular vision the way Genghis Khan intended. Still, the four corners that marked the edge of his empire are the shores of Korea, the tip of Egypt, the cold harsh landscape of Siberia, and just beyond the Crimea and current day Ukraine. 

There is always more to be said about Genghis Khan at war. After all, even the Germans and Russians sought to decipher the *Secret History* that best summarized his exploits in order to better understand total war. Even the German *blitzkrieg* is named after techniques Genghis invented. But 
## The Symbol that is Genghis Khan

A rhetorical question to set the stage. Do you think the largest contiguous empire the world ever saw was ruled strictly by fear (I must say continguous because otherwise the British Empire claims the title)? Of course not. It was ruled by understanding the simple needs of human heart, but forever ensuring that his people had access to everything else the world had to offer, and nothing less. None of this was done out of malice, and yet, as described by my very table of jokers, all we know is the Mongol Empire's malice. How did we get here?

Genkhis Khan's first blood was his step brother. The decision was simple. He could not fathom yielding to his older sibling, who's decision-making he considered inane. It would earn him the curses of his mother, for death was not taken lightly in the Mongol culture, especially inter-family killing. However, this moment illustrates a separation in thinking by Genghis Khan from the rest of his kin. To others, family was highest social structure, and it was not to be betrayed. To Genghis Khan, family would be a blessing and a curse, but nothing more than a tool at the end of the day. "The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb" is an apt phrase, capturing how Genghis Khan evolved his empire because it allowed him to exit the traditional mindset that kept his people so divided. 

As you may have guessed, the trait he held in highest regard was loyalty. Loyalty demonstrated in the past, and loyalty that continued every day. I make this distinction because while growing up, Genghis Khan had formed a brotherly bond with another warrior, <name>, who he held in equal regard. However, that friendship would turn to betrayal, and like many before Genghis Khan, if one did not demonstrate loyalty, one chose death.

I will return to loyalty in a moment, but I must first discuss how the Genghis Khan expanded his rule to further develop his person. Imagine a man who wanted only the best for his people, but every time he sought connection with others in hopes of trade and the exchange of ideas, his people were hurt, leaving him no choice but to fight. That is Genghis Khan. He was a man who would not yield, and if an envoy he sent was met with execution, then his executioners would endure the same fate.
	
Knowing this, whenever he conquered, whether it was a tribe, a city, or a nation, he would let the conquered peoples live as they were, but under his authority. That meant no  disruption of life, no barbaric execution, and no pillaging. If his armies were caught doing any of these shameful acts, they were shown no mercy.  But for a newly conquered people, this is when loyalty mattered the most. An unfortunate city may misunderstand his lax rule and stage a revolt. That city was met with swift and utter destruction. 
	
To his people Genghis Khan represented true warrior leadership, one that ensured fierce protection of their people while ushering in a new era of luxury. To be associated or descended from the great Khan was to inherit the same blessings he possesed from the Eternal Blue Sky or the Mountains of Bakkhur?? But what about
