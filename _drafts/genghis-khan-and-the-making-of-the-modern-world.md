Before I discuss the book <u>Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World</u> by Jack Weatherford, I want to tell you why I read this book. You'll never know where your next book will come from.

In the waning heat of  first week of June my friends and I were enjoying dinner at [Farmhouse Kitchen](https://www.yelp.com/biz/farmhouse-kitchen-thai-cuisine-menlo-park-2?osq=thai). One of said friends likes to probe our minds with interesting, but somewhat nonsensical questions. What followed next is the natural course of me entertaining her question.

"If you could learn any language in the world, but had to eat a person to learn that language, would you do it, and who would you eat?" she asked, during a lull in our conversation. For sake of brevity, I skip our little discussion about the morality of eating a person, as you can already guess what my answer is.

"Anyone, dead or alive, past or present?" I inquired. This was an innocent question. I had no ill-intent, initially.

"Uhh, okay yes. Anyone. But you also inherent their memories," she responded. This stipulation was strictly added in anticpation of me picking a heinous being like Jack the Ripper.  From her perspective, as a lover of languages, the torment of living with those memories would greatly outweigh the desire to know any language, let alone ... Old English, for this example. Unfortunately, it's difficult to anticpate me. 

I exclaimed that I would want nothing more to consume Genghis Khan and know everything about the largest land empire that ever existed. And of course, to learn their language. Of course.

A relentless stream of questions followed. Can you live with killing millions of people? What language did they even speak? You'd see all the rape and looting, and you could continue living with that?  Honestly, with such a hypothetical question, I wasn't giving it that much thought. Maybe at the end of the day, I'd become a raving lunatic, but at least I'd know what it was like.

What was the outcome of our serious academic discussion? That we didn't know diddly-squat about Genghis Khan, and whatever we were saying during the discussion was us parroting our vague memories about his exploits from a 7th grade textbook. 

A day or two later one of the other friends at our dinner messaged me about spotting a book about Genghis Khan at Costco. Within a few texts  we discovered her father had a copy of the book and that she could loan it to me. Another day went by and I was finally in possession of <u>Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World</u>. Without the ultimate primary source, this book and its collection of primary sources would serve as his replacement.

Now that I got the entertaining bits out of the way, lets dive into what truly memorialized Genghis Khan.

I've split this summary into three parts that matter to me: 
- The symbol that is Genghis Khan.
- The military prowess of the Mongol Empire.
- The geopolitical and socioeconomic impact of the Mongol Empire.

I do not wish to write about "the rise, the expansion, and the fall" of the Mongol Empire because that is a chronological retelling of the book in way I will not do justice. Instead it is my hope that from my summary of abstract topics, you will be intrigued enough to pick up the book and devour the details.  Weatherford has painstakingly covered every facet of Genghis Khan's life and his impact in the modern world. Right from the introduction, he invites you to revel in a piece of history that for 500 years was shrouded in so much secrecy I'm suprised it wasn't the center of another Indiana Jones film. 

## The Symbol that is Genghis Khan

A rhetorical question to set the stage. Do you think the largest contiguous empire the world ever saw was ruled strictly by fear (I must say continguous because otherwise the British Empire was the largest)? Of course not. It was ruled by understanding the simple needs of human heart, but forever ensuring that his people had access to everything else the world had to offer, and nothing less. None of this was done out of malice, and yet, as described by my very table of jokers, all we know is the Mongol Empire's malice. How did we get here?

Genkhis Khan's first blood was his step brother. The decision was simple. He could not fathom yielding to his older sibling, who's decision-making he considered inane. It would earn him the curses of his mother, for death was not taken lightly in the Mongol culture, especially inter-family killing. However, this moment illustrates a separation in thinking by Genghis Khan from the rest of his kin. To others, family was highest social structure, and it was not to be betrayed. To Genghis Khan, family would be a blessing and a curse, but nothing more than a tool at the end of the day. "The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb" is an apt phrase, capturing how Genghis Khan evolved his empire because it allowed him to exit the traditional mindset that kept his people so divided. 

As you may have guessed, the trait he held in highest regard was loyalty. Loyalty demonstrated in the past, and loyalty that continued every day. I make this distinction because while growing up, Genghis Khan had formed a brotherly bond with another warrior, <name>, who he held in equal regard. However, that friendship would turn to betrayal, and like many before Genghis Khan, if one did not demonstrate loyalty, one chose death.

I will return to loyalty in a moment, but I must first discuss how the Genghis Khan expanded his rule to further develop his person. Imagine a man who wanted only the best for his people, but every time he sought connection with others in hopes of trade and the exchange of ideas, his people were hurt, leaving him no choice but to fight. That is Genghis Khan. He was a man who would not yield, and if envoy he sent was met with execution, then his executioners would endure the same fate.
	
Knowing this, whenever he conquered, whether it was a tribe, a city, or a nation, he would let the conquered peoples live as they were, but under his authority. That meant no  disruption of life, no barbaric execution, no pillaging, nothing. If his armies were caught doing any of these shameful acts, they were shown no mercy.  But for the conquered people, this is when loyalty mattered the most. One unfortunate city would confuse the laxity of rule
