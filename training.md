What are my specialties? 

First, I'm an [NASM CPT](https://www.nasm.org/certified-personal-trainer-a) and a licensed [PPSC Coach](https://getppsc.com/). When it comes to the nuts and bolts of training, I have you covered.

But after training for over ten years, my specialty lies in achieving goals despite injury. With injury or adversity,  I take my time to understand what the best in the business do to  handle similar situations, and scale the expectations down to what is possible.  Who's got the strongest and most explosive calves in any task? Ballet dancers. Who has the strongest and most mobile shoulders? Gymnasts and circus artists. Plenty of powerlifters have suffered a disc herniation and come back stronger than before.  Studying the best reveals how  even recreational athletes can achieve more than they  previously thought possible.

Sometimes you have to rest. But there are plenty of ways to keep inching towards your goals without letting injury stop you.

Here are some of my recent numbers with regards to athletic performance:

- 181 lb, 12.1% body fat as of January 2024
- 32 inch vertical
- 210 lb power clean
- 245 lb bench press
- 500 lb trap bar deadlift

There is a glaring lack of any endurance achievements, but my sport choices tend to be more anaerobic in nature.

This is a non-exhaustive list of what injuries I've been through:

- Jumper's Knee (Patellar Tendinopathy)
- Shoulder Surgery (Anterior Labrum repair)
- Bicep Surgery (Bicep Tendon Repair)
- Plantar Fasciopathy
- Achilles Tendinopathy
- Lower Back Disc Herniation
- Golfer's Elbow (Medial Epicondylitis)
- ACL Reconstruction Surgery with Partial Menisectomy 

In spite of many of these injuries, I have enjoyed playing sport at at a competitive level, including a two-day indoor BB volleyball tournament tournament as a middle blocker. I've done my best to enjoy sport even in times of less than stellar health.

Regardless of where you are in your fitness journey, I hope I can help you succeed.
