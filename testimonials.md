### Testimonials

**Vivek**

*Joraaver is nothing short of an exceptional coach and personal trainer. Over the past year and a half, I found myself sidelined from playing volleyball due to the relentless grip of chronic and debilitating patella tendinopathy. Watching my friends and teammates continue to progress on the court while I grappled with the daunting notion of never playing volleyball pain-free again was emotionally taxing. The road to recovery, marked by its slow and subtle progress, seemed like an insurmountable challenge.*

*In this trying period, Joraaver guided me through recovery. His approach was marked by meticulous planning, where each exercise and regimen was thoughtfully tailored to guide me back to sport, and address weaknesses. Despite my limited understanding of how individual workout sessions contributed to long-term recovery, Joraaver skillfully kept my return to sport goals in sight and devised comprehensive schedules to inch closer to them.*

*What truly sets Joraaver apart is his unwavering commitment to his clients. He not only hears my questions and concerns but also takes the time to educate me on the intricate science of tendon recovery and other musculoskeletal phenomena that I’m interested in. When I need to adjust workout plans, or make changes to scheduling for various personal reasons he figures out the best way to do this while keeping me on track even on short notice. His dedication to my well-being and his ability to demystify the approaches to recovery of my condition instilled in me a sense of empowerment and understanding.*

*After several months of working closely with Joraaver, I am elated to announce that I've recently been able to step back onto the volleyball court pain free. Now I’m practicing hitting lines, playing games, and overall enjoying the sport I love without fear. This remarkable journey to recovery would not have been possible without Joraaver's exceptional guidance and expertise. In my opinion he is, without a doubt, a game-changer for sports rehabilitation and personal training goals.*

*I highly endorse Joraaver as a personal trainer. Before I started working with him, I was in a bit of a physical and mental rut with an inefficient workout routine that left me fatigued and constantly hitting plateaus on several lifts.*

*Joraaver helped me overcome my problems with his uniquely educational approach to training. He asked a lot of questions in our first session to help me more clearly define my goals, build a program I could maintain consistently, and helped me learn and progress throughout the entire process. While the programs he structured for me are great, they are just the shell. I believe his true value is in helping his clients understand the fundamental principles behind every part of a training regimen. From helping me understand the levers of sets and reps, quality vs quanitty, and helping me improve my technique through video reviews, he has equipped me with the skills to change my routines as I need to solve the problems and hit the goals that I set. The ability to be adaptable and make better decisions in the gym has been invaluable as I continue my fitness journey. As an result of the effectiveness of his guidance, I went from plateauing while bulking to now increasing or at worst, maintaining, my strength while on a cut.*

*Beyond strength training, Joraaver as equipped me with invaluable knowledge on rehabilitating pain and tendonitis. Before I worked with him, daily tasks like typing or driving were causing constant elbow pain. Thanks to his expertise and rehab strategy, I can now do pull-ups and other intensive elbow movements with little to no pain.*
  
*Working with Joraaver has been transformative on how I view fitness and training - I have a much more knowledgeable understanding of how to define more concrete goals, how to build an effective strategy, and how to improve on the techniques that will get me there. As a result, I feel like this has impacted my life outside of the gym - his educated approach has given me a broader understanding of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, which has improved my overall confidence. If you’re looking for a trainer to listen and help you understand your needs and how to get there, I cannot recommend Joraaver enough.*

*Joraaver is an amazing coach. Three things I want to highlight:*

*1. Joraaver excels at accommodating and addressing chronic issues.*

*I’ve always been fairly active, but for the last 10 years have struggled with persistent shoulder and neck issues. Since we started working together, Joraaver has been incorporating exercises to combat these issues and over the course of 1.5 years, my posture has improved and I’m pain free.*

*2. Joraaver helps me set and meet my fitness goals.*

*I’ve always wanted to run a marathon, but have had to stop training in the past due to injury. Joraaver helped me change my plan of attack by incorporating more strengthening exercises and changing my diet. Third time’s the charm - I ran a marathon in July 2022 and Joraaver was there to see me cross the finish line. Similarly, I’ve never been able to do a push up, but within 3 months of working with Joraaver, I was able to do 5.*

*3. Joraaver’s great at working through sensitive topics, like issues with motivation and insecurities around weight.*

*It can be tough to talk to a trainer about weight, especially when it’s a deep seated insecurity. Joraaver’s always leant a sympathetic ear, and I’ve found that he strikes the right balance between encouraging clients to improve and helping them acknowledge and learn from failure.*

*Joraaver is nothing short of a game-changer when it comes to personal training. His down-to-earth demeanor and extensive knowledge are just the tip of the iceberg in describing his expertise. It's evident that he's not just a trainer; he's a passionate advocate for injury recovery and prevention, demonstrating an unwavering commitment to helping individuals safely return to their sports.*

*Having undergone multiple knee surgeries, including two ACL reconstructions, I found myself facing yet another setback with a partial meniscus tear. It was during this challenging time that Joraaver's impact became truly remarkable. Within days of my injury, he crafted a personalized routine that not only addressed my immediate concerns but also laid the foundation for a full return to my sport.*

*Joraaver's thoughtful and individualized approach stood out. He didn't just prescribe exercises; he considered my unique circumstances and demonstrated a genuine care for my well-being. In our weekly coaching sessions, his ability to blend scientific knowledge with insights into the mental aspects of recovery was invaluable. No question was too small, and his explanations delved into both the science and the psychology behind the process.*

*The routines he designed for me not only rebuilt my physical strength but instilled a newfound confidence in the stability of my knee. Thanks to Joraaver, I am not only back on the snow and water, enjoying my sports, but I do so with a level of assurance and strength I hadn't thought possible. If you're seeking a personal trainer who goes above and beyond, Joraaver is the epitome of dedication, expertise, and personalized care."*

*Joraaver is the best trainer I’ve worked with for a number of reasons. To highlight a few:*

*Joraaver is a great listener and does a great job of developing a program to help you achieve your specific goals. His routines are challenging but 100% doable, and you feel great after completing them. He’s also very receptive to feedback and will change your plan as needed based on progression / how difficult you find certain exercises.* 

*Aside from helping you achieve strength / endurance goals, he takes health seriously and will often incorporate what I consider “support exercises”; in other words, exercises designed to ensure joint / muscular health so you not only reach but surpass your goals. For example, he recently incorporated a number of calf strengthening / ankle mobility exercises into my routine to deal with right ankle tendon issues I’ve been experiencing recently on long runs.*

*Finally, I’d like to emphasize that Joraaver really cares. He genuinely wants to see you succeed. You are not just another dollar sign to him, which is a feeling I’ve gotten from other trainers I’ve worked with.*

**Akhil**

*I used to be a regular at the gym, but after the pandemic hit, I fell out of my routine and my weight started to creep up. I tried working with a few trainers at the gym, but they all seemed to have the same cookie-cutter routine that wasn't really helping me achieve my goals.*

*Within 6 months of working with Joraaver, I was back to my pre-pandemic strength. And by the 9-month mark, I had surpassed all of my lifting goals. I even started doing movements that I never thought I would be able to do, like bodyweight dips.*

*I used to be so self-conscious about my body, but Joraaver helped me to see my true potential. He's helped me to build strength, confidence, and a healthy lifestyle. I'm so grateful for his help.*

*If you're looking for a personal trainer who will help you crush your goals, I highly recommend Joraaver. He's the real deal.*

**Sith** 

*I have never been a regular at the gym. However, after not doing much during the pandemic. I started having extreme neck/back muscle pains in everyday life. I have seen multiple physical therapists, but it was hard to figure things out. Joraaver was able to quickly create a routine specific to my needs and told me the point of focus during the exercise.  If you need help recovering from muscle pains or getting stronger, beginner or not, keep Joraaver in mind.*
