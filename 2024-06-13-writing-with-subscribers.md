Before this post, I didn’t have a “subscribe” button. Instead, I wrote when the mood struck, and if I thought someone may benefit from my thoughts, or they were the inspiration for my thoughts, I’d link them to my post. I’ve written on Medium before, but I didn’t like maintaining a personal website and a Medium page. The Consultation and Testimonials pages are recent additions as well. Those used to be maintained via LinkTree, but I the same feelings resurged. Thus, I consolidated everything under my personal website. One place, one brand. 

The only sacrifice? No subscriber list. It wasn’t a hill I wanted to die on. I preferred the idea of maintaining a corner of the internet that folks occasionally came across (because I stand on the shoulders of the giant named SEO). They would come, they would read, and they would leave. 

Recently, a friend learned I had a blog, and, with I’d imagine an incredulous gasp (the conversation occurred over text), asked, “WHY DID U NOT SAY EARLIER?” To which humble ol’ me replied, “I write for me.” 

This is a lie. I know this to be a lie. I wish I were so noble. Long ago I even saved a quotation on this very subject because it struck a cord with me:

> “[You write out of the] desire to seem clever, to be talked about, to be remembered after death, etc., etc., etc. It is humbug to pretend this is not a motive and a strong one.” —George Orwell

You the man, George. If I didn't want someone to read, I’d go write in my journal. Instead, I sit here, thinking harder than I should about a collection of words with the hope that it may resonate with someone. 

TODO IMAGE

This book, collecting dust in my library, entreats me to be read, but with a gentler ambition than my initial attempts: one essay at a time. I am at fault, the completionist that I am; eighty pages in and I haven’t picked it up since. It is my primary inspiration to write, but I always fight to craft  the language that seems so effortless to those essayists. Someday my writing style won’t be because that’s all I know, but because I have chosen it amongst all I know. Till then, one must read more and write more.

Eventually, another friend asked why I didn’t use Substack. Clearly, my internal struggle is lost on her. However, her writing is phenomenal, and I aspire to enjoy her imagination with words. What's worse, I can only enjoy her writing courtesy of Substack.  Quite the quandary.

The people continue to speak, and I must listen. So now you can subscribe to my work. What a glorious day this is!

*For those interested in how I actually set it up, the following blurb is for you*

The setup was trivial. I only opened 60 tabs, investigated 5 different mailers, and spent four hours earning a quick masters in the subject. 

1. Choose your mailer. I have chosen Mailchimp. On the free plan I can have up to 500 contacts. I pray that that threshold is tested.
2. Integrate a “Subscribe” button. On this static site, I went ahead with an embedded form rather than a pop-up. I made this choice to avoid JavaScript and enjoy faster load times. You make your decision.
3. Add an RSS feed. This is specific to this site and most static sites, especial Jekyll ones.
4. Create a Mailchimp RSS campaign. This is another benefit of Mailchimp.

That’s it. I hope you are enthralled by how I combined philosophical and technical details into one post.
